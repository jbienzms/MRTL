# HoloLens MDM Hands on Lab – Preparation

## Requirements

To complete the hands on lab, you will need:   
1.	An M365 Tenancy configured with at least
 M365 E3 (AADP1, Intune, at a minimum)
2.	A HoloLens Device

## Preparation

AutoPilot registration can take up to 24 hours to flow through the AAD environments, so to enable the hands-on lab, completing these steps after the 101 training is recommended.   
There are 3 key tasks to prepare for autopilot. 
1.	Obtain Hardware Hash of HoloLens Device
2.	Create AAD Group for AutoPilot Devices
3.	Assign and AutoPilot profile to the HoloLens device.

### Obtain Hardware Hash
1.	Reset your HoloLens Device to Factory Settings. This can be achieved by following the steps at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens-recovery#clean-reflash-the-device
2.	It would be recommended to use the ARC tool to update the device aswell, as this will provide the latest General Available build for the HoloLens.
3.	Obtain the Hardware Hash following the steps at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens2-autopilot#obtain-hardware-hash
4.	Register your device in Intune following the steps at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/hololens2-autopilot#register-device-through-mem
5.	Set the “Group Tag” to “HoloLens”

### Create AAD Group for HoloLens Devices  
   
1.	Go to the Azure Portal, portal.azure.com, navigate to Azure Active Directory

**NOTE: For the purposes of this set up we will be using dynamic enrollment to add all our HoloLens devices to a device security group.**


2.	Create a new Dynamic Security group called “HoloLens AutoPilot Devices”

4.	Select Edit at the end of the Rule Syntax box  

5.	Within the rules syntax box, use the following membership rule
a.	(device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq "[OrderID]:HoloLens"))

6.	Hit OK, Go back to the previous page where you can select Save and wait for the group membership to be updated.

### Create and Assign AutoPilot Profile to the device.    

1.	Open Endpoint Manager (endpoint.microsoft.com),

Figure 18 - HoloLens Autopilot profile summary  

a.	Within the Autopilot Deployment Profiles section, create a HoloLens deployment profile within the following settings:  

| Setting | Configuration | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | HoloLens Autopilot Profile |Name for the policy.|  
| Device Type  |HoloLens	 |Required
| Deployment Mode |	Self-Deploying (Preview) |	Required |
| Join to Azure AD As |	Azure AD Joined |	Required |
| Language (Region) |Operating System Default |Retains Defaults. Could be changed if multi language is a requirement  |
| Automatically configure Keyboard |	Yes|	
Microsoft Software License Terms |	Hide | 	Required
| Hide Change Account Options |	Hide |	Required|
| Privacy Settings |Hide |Required
| Apply Device Name Template| Yes |	To create a naming convention for the devices
| Enter a Name |MSFT-%RAND:4%	| To create a naming convention for the devices |
| Assignment 
| Include | HoloLens Autopilot Devices |	To apply to all HoloLens Devices | 

The following is an example of how your properties could look in the portal:-

**You want to make sure that when you assign this profile you got to the Included groups and you select the group you created**

### Validation
Within the Windows Autopilot Devices tab, validate that your device says has a profile status of “Assigned”. This may take up to 24 hours to show.
